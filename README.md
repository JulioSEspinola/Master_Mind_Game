# Master_Mind_Game
I created this fun game of Master Mind in my free time. I hope you enjoy to play it as much as I do. The rules for the game are simple to understand. Everyting that there's to it is some patience and be able to identify some patterns.

The rules for the game are the following:
1) In the blank box you'll need to enter the four initials from the colors shows in the game.
2) After entering your guess you will need to click the lines in the left so you can place your guess
3)After placing your guess. You can recieve white dots, black dots or blank dots.

black dots = you have entered the right color in the right place
white dots = you have entered the right color, but in the incorrect place
blank dots = you have selected the wrong color and place

4) Follow the steps 1-3 to see if you get the four black dots to Win the game.
